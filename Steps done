✅ Steps Completed

GCP VM Setup

Created a Compute Engine instance (Debian/Ubuntu).

Installed Docker + Docker Compose.

Domain Pointing

In your registrar’s DNS settings:

Set A record for vistavitech.com → 34.93.103.188 (your VM IP).

Set CNAME record for www.vistavitech.com → vistavitech.com.

Waited for DNS propagation (verified with nslookup).

Firewall Rules

In GCP VM settings, enabled:

✅ Allow HTTP traffic

✅ Allow HTTPS traffic

Caddy Setup (Reverse Proxy + SSL)

Created a docker-compose.yml with:

caddy service (handles HTTPS + certificates).

vistavitech-site service (your website container).

Mounted volumes for Caddyfile and cert storage.

Caddyfile Configuration

Initial config: reverse proxy vistavitech.com → vistavitech-site:80.

SSL certificates automatically issued by Let’s Encrypt (verified by logs).

GitHub Pages Conflict Fix

Previously, www.vistavitech.com pointed to GitHub Pages (*.github.io).

Removed/unpublished GitHub Pages to avoid split hosting.

Updated DNS so www → vistavitech.com.

Canonical Domain Setup

Added redirect in Caddyfile:

www.vistavitech.com → https://vistavitech.com

Ensures one main domain for SEO & SSL consistency.

Verification

Logs confirm SSL cert obtained:

certificate obtained successfully | identifier: vistavitech.com


https://vistavitech.com loads correctly with valid SSL.
